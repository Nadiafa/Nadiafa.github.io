This has been an interesting project.  I was able to implement some of the functionalities I thought of while working in my Rails project, like rendering next and previous resources, dynamic rendering and changing the URL to better match the rendered content.

The latter in particular was very useful, as not only do I think it is great to be able to edit the URL, but it also helped me at the initial stages to know that I was rendering correctly by using dummy text.
I am happy to have learned this with `.pushState()`.
