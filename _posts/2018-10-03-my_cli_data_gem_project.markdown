I have finally completed my first project. I decided to go with a program that shows the current exhibitions in the British Museum. Although it has taken me a little longer than expected, I do hope the project review feedback is positive.

It has been a little more challenging than I expected. I needed to go back to several topics, but with extra review and support, I have a working program.

The most challenging part for me has been the use of properties, as I didn't fully understand but I have learnt now how to implement them, although I do feel that I still need so much more practice.

It was time-consuming finding the right website to scrap. However, the search has given me the opportunity to do more scraping and get comfortable with it.

Overall it was a good experience and I am looking forward to moving along in the course and to more coding!
