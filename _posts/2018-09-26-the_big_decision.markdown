I find myself at the begining of an online course to become a web developer and I think of how scary and exciting this is!

A year ago I knew very little about this world. I was just starting to find out what all those letters in the black background meant when curiosity got the better of me. Since then it has been difficult spend one day not wanting to learn more. 

I started learning some of the (very) basics online. There are a lot of free resources online - you can spend a lifetime watching tutorials and reading documentation. It is hard to learn everything you need this way though. I needed some guidance and structure to take the right steps.

While I found myself regularly looking for a few minutes in my day to continue learning, it was difficult to keep everything in from one short session to another. I was enjoying learning but I needed to dedicate more time to it, which was not easy while also being fully dedicated to a demanding full time job. And so, I had to make a decision - very long days and potentially years to learn to code, or... the scarier option of going for it, become a full time student.

What I thought was going to be a very tough decision wasn't so much so, and here I am! 
I quit my job. I am learning to code full time and I love it! 

I am now working on my first Faltiron project, so more to come on that soon.

Wish me luck!
