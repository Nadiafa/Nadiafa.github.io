I find myself at the beginning of an online course to become a web developer. So scary and exciting!

A year ago I knew very little about this world. I was just starting to find out what all those letters in the black background meant, and then curiosity got the better of me. It has been difficult, ever since, to spend one day not wanting to learn more. 

I started learning some (very) basics online. There are a lot of free resources - you can spend a lifetime watching tutorials and reading documentation. It was hard, as a newbie, to learn everything this way though. I needed some guidance and structure to take the right steps.

While I found myself regularly looking for a few minutes in my day to continue learning, it was difficult to keep everything in from one short session to another. I was enjoying learning but I needed to dedicate more time to it, which was not easy while also being fully dedicated to a demanding full-time job. And so, I had to make a decision - very long days and potentially years to learn to code, or... the scarier option of going for it, become a full-time student.

What I thought was going to be a very tough decision wasn't so much so, and here I am! 
I quit my job. I did some research while I continued learning online, and finally signed up for a Flatiron course. I am learning to code full time and I love it! 

I am now working on my first Flatiron project, so more to come on that soon.

Wish me luck!
