I have been progressing on my FSWD journey and think it is amazing how much you learn in a short time.

There is still much that I need to fully understand, and so, based on my experience I cannot stress enough the need to practice practice and practice. 

I have found that there were some lessons that didn't go in very deep into the subject, and that is fine for the purpose of having a basic understanding but the more you do, the better you understand.
I am also learning that errors are great learning opportunities, as much as they can be a headache.

From both learning and motivation perspectives, I have found that while  moving forward it is not always obvious how much you know until you say it out loud. Discussing your code, labs and tests with someone else is a fantastic way to learn and to realise how much you've actually learnt which is super encouraging!
