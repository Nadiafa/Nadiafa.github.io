Form my final project I decided to do something that I could use during my next step in becoming a professional developer. I created an application that allows me to keep track of job postings that I find interesting and to set a status for each of them based on whether is a posting I am interested in, applied, etc,...

Trying to keep the project as simple as possible I worked with just one model and kept the application basic, although I do have a bunch of stretch  golas to take care of later on such as further edits, and delete.

The most challenging part I found to be the redux flow and understanding the way we trigger actions from a component and actions dispatch reducers. Once I came to terms with this all became much clearer.

Once I complete my assessment I look forward to continue improving the application and becoming faster and better!
