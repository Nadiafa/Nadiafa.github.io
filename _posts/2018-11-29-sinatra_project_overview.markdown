For this second project I have been more proactive in joining study groups and it has really paid off.

I have kept busy with those sessions as well as preparing for the project with a mock app. All has been going well so far and I now have just a little more work before submitting.

The biggest challenge has been understanding where some methods came from and what the different gems do. So some more studying/reading on those is needed for me. The problem may have been that I found hard to completely understand the documentation on gems, but slowly, I am starting to get it. 

So this project so far has gone well and I have found it enjoyable.
