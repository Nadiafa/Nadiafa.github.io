Here goes a blog post for my Rails project that I thought I would have been writting a few weeks ago! ðŸ˜…
I have ended up having to review most of the rails lessons when I strated my project. However, frustrating that was, it was also most beneficial.

I've enjoyed learning the power of the rails generators, and working with RESTful routes. The basic forms were fine to handle, the nested ones.... no so much! I was a bit stuck with them until I got some help, but I'm on my way to mastery!!!
